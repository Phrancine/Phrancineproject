The Enormendous Snowball

Inspiration Website: 



<p> 
The winter day was perfect
The weather was just right
Packing snow they called it
Had fallen the previous night
</p>

<p> 
The kids they were excited
Dressed in mittens and in hats
Meeting on the highest hill
Said “Come on, let’s build it fast!”
</p>

<p>
Starting with just a snowball
They rolled it round and round
All across the vast hilltop
On the bright and snowy ground
</p>

<p>
“We will make a giant snowman
The biggest that can be!”
Said they grunting and pushing
Working with industrious glee
</p>

<p>
It grew bigger and wider
And with each roll it became
Far too big to push with few
They cried “help!” and many came
</p>

<p>
Close to the edge they rolled it
So all in the town could see
Got stuck and stopped moving
They pushed, backed against a tree
</p>

<p>
It resisted for a moment
Moving inches but not a lot
And then before they knew it
It took off like a great shot
</p>

<p>
Watching with awe and wonder
As the snowball ran away
Rolling faster and farther
Growing bigger on its way
</p>

<p>
First it hit a line of trees
That were planted in the spring
They were rolled into the ball
With quite a number of things
</p>

<p>
A few snow sleds were taken
And skaters on the ice rink
Workers by the deep sewers
Even a large kitchen sink
</p>

<p>
It rolled down into a street
Chasing cars and Socks the stray
Many people shouted loudly
“Oh no! It’s coming our way”
</p>

<p>
It kept rolling and rolling
Taking all in its snowy fold
Including a group of seniors
Out for a walk in the cold
</p>

<p>
How will we ever stop it?
The town people cried in fear
“No idea” said some buskers
Let’s hope something will appear
</p>

<p>
The kids knew what was needed
And told the adults their plan
Parking their cars in the road
With one or two mini vans
</p>

<p>
The snowball it kept rolling
Following the path they made
It bounded off the parked cars
Right past the town arcade
</p>

<p>
It turned and it swerved
Following their clever trail
Heading south then due north
All hoping it would not fail
</p>

<p>
It rounded the last corner
The snowball racing faster
And all did hold their breath
Hoping for no disaster
</p>

<p>
It crashed, totally smashed
Against the new city hall
Bursting itself wide open
Lining the entire brick wall
</p>

<p>
They had built a huge snowman
Enormendous some did say
It was made from everything
On that cold and wintery day
</p>

<p>
Then firemen did come blaring
They pulled out their largest hose
And from the top to the bottom
Watered it down to wet clothes
</p>

<p>
The kids were quite unhappy
To see it all melt away
But though they lost their snowman
They went skating which was super OK
</p>
