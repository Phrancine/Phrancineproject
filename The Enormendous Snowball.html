<div class="leftSide">
<p>The  winter day was perfect </p>
<p>The weather was just right </p>
<p>Packing snow they called it </p>
<p>Had fallen the previous night</p>
<br></br>
</div>

<div class="rightSide"
<p>The kids they were excited </p>
<p>Dressed in mittens and in hats</p>
<p>Meeting on the highest hill</p>
<p>Said “Come on, let’s build it fast!”</p>
<br></br>
</div>


<p class="Left">Starting with just a snowball</p>
<p>They rolled it round and round</p>
<p>All across the vast hilltop</p>
<p>On the bright and snowy ground</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">We will make a giant snowman</p>
<p>The biggest that can be!”</p>
<p>Said they grunting and pushing</p>
<p>Working with industrious glee</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Left">It grew bigger and wider</p>
<p>And with each roll it became</p>
<p>Far too big to push with few</p>
<p>They cried “help!” and many came</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">Close to the edge they rolled it</p>
<p>So all in the town could see</p>
<p>Got stuck and stopped moving</p>
<p>They pushed, backed against a tree</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Left">It resisted for a moment</p>
<p>Moving inches but not a lot</p>
<p>And then before they knew it</p>
<p>It took off like a great shot</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">Watching with awe and wonder</p>
<p>As the snowball ran away</p>
<p>Rolling faster and farther</p>
<p>Growing bigger on its way</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Left">First it hit a line of trees</p>
<p>That were planted in the spring</p>
<p>They were rolled into the ball</p>
<p>With quite a number of things</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">A few snow sleds were taken</p>
<p>And skaters on the ice rink</p>
<p>Workers by the deep sewers</p>
<p>Even a large kitchen sink</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Left">It rolled down into a street</p>
<p>Chasing cars and Socks the stray</p>
<p>Many people shouted loudly</p>
<p>“Oh no! It’s coming our way”</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">It kept rolling and rolling</p>
<p>Taking all in its snowy fold</p>
<p>Including a group of seniors</p>
<p>Out for a walk in the cold</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Left">How will we ever stop it?</p>
<p>The town people cried in fear</p>
<p>“No idea” said some buskers</p>
<p>Let’s hope something will appear</p>
<br></br>

<p class="Right">The kids knew what was needed</p>
<p>And told the adults their plan</p>
<p>Parking their cars in the road</p>
<p>With one or two mini vans</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Left">The snowball it kept rolling</p>
<p>Following the path they made</p>
<p>It bounded off the parked cars</p>
<p>Right past the town arcade</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Right">It turned and it swerved</p>
<p>Following their clever trail</p>
<p>Heading south then due north</p>
<p>All hoping it would not fail</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Left">It rounded the last corner</p>
<p>The snowball racing faster</p>
<p>And all did hold their breath</p>
<p>Hoping for no disaster</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Right">It crashed, totally smashed</p>
<p>Against the new city hall</p>
<p>Bursting itself wide open</p>
<p>Lining the entire brick wall</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Left">They had built a huge snowman</p>
<p>Enormendous some did say</p>
<p>It was made from everything</p>
<p>On that cold and wintery day</p>
<br></br>


<p class="Right">Then firemen did come blaring</p>
<p>They pulled out their largest hose</p>
<p>And from the top to the bottom</p>
<p>Watered it down to wet clothes</p>
<br></br>



<p class="Left">The kids were quite unhappy</p>
<p>To see it all melt away</p>
<p>But though they lost their snowman</p>
<p>They went skating which was super OK</p>
</ul>
<br></br>
